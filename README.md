This repository is dedicated to the implementation of classical machine learning algorithms from scratch, without the use of external libraries. The goal is to provide a clear and educational resource for understanding the inner workings of these algorithms.

## Implemented Algorithms

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- The KNN algorithm is implemented without relying on external libraries. The code is structured to demonstrate the core concepts of this simple yet effective classification algorithm.

## Repository Structure

- `1.KNN.ipynb`: Contains the implementation of the KNN algorithm.
- `data/`: Includes datasets used for testing the implemented algorithms.
- `charts/`: Holds visualizations and charts generated during the analysis.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NikhilKrSharma/classical_ml_algorithms.git
    cd classical_ml_algorithms
    ```

2. Explore the implemented algorithms in the respective Python files.

3. Check the `data/` directory for included datasets and the `charts/` directory for visualizations.

Feel free to use this repository for educational purposes, exploration, or as a reference for understanding the foundational concepts behind classical machine learning algorithms. Contributions and enhancements are welcome.

## Notes

- The focus of this repository is on educational purposes and the manual implementation of classical ML algorithms.
- No external libraries are used in the algorithm implementations.
- Visualizations and charts provide insights into the algorithms' performance.

Happy exploring and learning!
